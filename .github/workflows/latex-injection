latex equetion genrator is a web server to execute the equetion of maths

we try to latex injection

search github latex injection

we use this injection script

code = $\lstinputlisting{/etc/passwd}$

if show /etc/passwd than it is hackable by this code

you can try to add reverse shell to replace this /etc/passwd
but my case this not execute shell so i try something diffrent

$\lstinputlisting{/var/www/dev/.htpasswd}$

now i see user and enocded hash
and i decrypt the hash and i access the ssh shell with user to show the hash

HAPPY HACKING
